              Getting Pixels by burning the GITC token on the Base blockchain
              is <strong>optional</strong>: every item can be earned by
              playing. The GITC you pay is sent to the burn address and
              destroyed. Nobody receives it, including {LEGAL_NAME}, and a burn
              cannot be refunded. By choosing this method, you acknowledge and
